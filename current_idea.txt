Project Aim: Some solutions to improve the mood of people. User would be recommended stuffs as per his/her current mood.

We get the mood of the person by performing sentiment analysis on his text. Then as per the current mood, he would be suggested entertaining stuffs like movies, e-books, etc.
Things like movies can be suggested irrespective of the mood (actually depending on the genre). But if he/she is angry, sad or is feared (may be because of watching some 
horror movie), then suggesting e-books is no good solution, rather suggesting something related to comedy is a great solution.

Possible use case: This project can probably bring some impact if implemented, because when people are angry or sad, they might do something (like verbal abuse) or make some
inappropriate decision, for which they would regret later, but if the model are successful in identifying the mood of the person before-hand, then it can be prevented 
(given that the conversation going on virtually).

Possible implementation:
If a user types something rude on a chatting software (say Whatsapp), and the model identifies the mood as 'anger', then it could bring a pop-up or send notification saying:
"You seem to be angry at the moment. Would you like to refresh your mood with some:
Music
Games
Movies"

There is a possibility that the user clicks it. The notification need to be sent before the user has sent the message.

The user won't be sent any notification when the mood is neutral, or some positive mood.

The possible implementation code is given. The code is presented in a very raw form containing just some if-else statements. This code can obviously be improved by using more 
complex conditions (and may be some loops), adding more entertainment options, incorporating Recommender Systems for improving user experience, etc.
